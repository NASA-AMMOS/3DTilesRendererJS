### Changed
- Compatible three.js version to v0.123.0.

## [0.1.7] - 2020-11-09
### Changed
- `PriorityQueue` to wait a frame to schedule new tasks instead of using `Promise.resolve` so tasks will only be started once per frame.

## [0.1.6] - 2020-10-08
### Added
- `batchTable` and `featureTable` fields onto loaded B3DM, I3DM, and PNTS scene objects directly.
- `stopAtEmptyTiles` which defaults to false so tilesets correctly stop traversal at empty tiles.

- Typescript declaration files for `CMPT`, `I3DM`, and `PNTS` loaders.

## [0.1.5] - 2020-08-21
### Added

- `manager` field to `TilesRenderer` to enable support for DRACO decompression.
- `TilesRenderer.onLoadTileSet` callback function.
- Support for "ADD" tile refinement.

## [0.1.4] - 2020-07-17
### Added

- `TilesRenderer.dispose` function to completely dispose of all loaded geometry, materials, and textures in the scene when the renderer is no longer needed.
- `TilesRenderer.onDisposeModel` function which is called when a tile model is disposed of from the cache.

### Fixed

- Case where the url protocol was converted to use a single slash instead of two when loading a model.
- Corner case where an error was thrown if the tileset was dragged off screen out of camera view.

## [0.1.3] - 2020-07-12
### Added

- Basic support for CMPT, PNTS, and I3DM file formats.
- `autoDisableRendererCulling` field to `TilesRenderer`.
- A count of the amount of failed tile content loads to `TilesRenderer.stats`.

### Fixed

- Failed tileset downloads being indefinitely retried.
- Tile content stats not being correctly updated if a tile failed to load.

- DebugTilesRenderer using a different color for every submesh in a tile. Now a single color is used for every submesh in a tile.
- Tiles not rendering if an empty tile is encountered.
- Child tiles not rendering if a parent tile content failed to load.

### Changed

- Improved `update` function performance by deferring LRUCache array update.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-06-08
